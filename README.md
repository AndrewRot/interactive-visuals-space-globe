# Interactive Music Visuals (Adobe Animate / ActionScript)

An interactive music visualization project built in **Adobe Animate (ActionScript 3)**, originally created for a **creative music video submission** and later adapted for **live DJ performance visuals**.

This project turns the keyboard into an instrument — visual elements on screen react in real time to **keyboard inputs** and **music playback**, creating a performable audiovisual experience.

## 🎵 Project Context

- **Created:** May 2020  
- **Original Use:** Creative music video submission for a **Louis the Child** track  
- **Live Use:** Performed as **projection-based music visuals** alongside DJ sets  
- **Location:** San Francisco  

The visuals were designed to be *played live*, allowing the performer to manipulate motion, effects, and visual layers dynamically while music played.

## ✨ Features

### Keyboard-Driven Visuals
Visual elements are mapped to specific keyboard inputs, allowing expressive control during playback:

- **Arrow Keys** – Directional motion, scene navigation, or effect modulation  
- **W / A / S / D** – Movement, transformations, or layer control  
- **Number Keys (1–9)** – Trigger visual modes, presets, or animations  

### Reactive Music Visuals
- Visual elements respond to music (amplitude, rhythm, or timing-based cues)
- Designed for synchronization with live or prerecorded tracks
- Optimized for projection environments

### Performance-Oriented Design
- Built for **live manipulation**
- Encourages improvisation during DJ sets or visual performances
- Scales well for large projections

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Adobe Animate**
- **ActionScript 3**
- Keyboard event listeners for real-time input
- Timeline + code-driven animation logic

---

## ▶️ How It Works

1. Open the project in **Adobe Animate**
2. Run the main timeline / document class
3. Play music (embedded or external, depending on setup)
4. Use the keyboard to interact with and perform the visuals live

> This project was not designed as a passive animation — it’s meant to be *played*.

## 📽️ Live Performance Use

The program was used as **projection visuals** alongside DJ sets, reacting to both:
- Performer input (keyboard)
- The music environment

This made it adaptable to different venues, tracks, and performance styles.

---

## 📁 Notes

- This is an older project and reflects workflows common in ActionScript-era Adobe Animate
- Some assets or references may be hardcoded or environment-specific
- Intended more as a **creative artifact** than a polished, reusable framework

---

## 🧠 Inspiration

Influenced by:
- Live VJ performance tools
- Interactive audiovisual instruments
- Club and festival projection aesthetics
